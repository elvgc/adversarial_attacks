It ensures that sensitive data is not accessed or viewed by individuals who are not authorized to do so.\n\nIntegrity, on the other hand, refers to safeguarding the accuracy and trustworthiness of information. It ensures that data is not modified, deleted, or altered in any way that could compromise its authenticity or accuracy.\n\nAvailability refers to ensuring timely and reliable access to systems and data. It ensures that systems and data are accessible and usable when needed, and that they are not disrupted or denied access to authorized users.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider the following example:\n\n* Confidentiality: A company has a confidential document that contains sensitive business information. The document is stored on a secure server, and only authorized personnel have access to it. This is an example of confidentiality in action.\n* Integrity: A company has a database that contains customer information. The company ensures that the data is accurate and up-to-date by regularly updating and verifying the information. This is an example of integrity in action.\n* Availability: A company's website is experiencing technical difficulties, and customers are unable to access it. The company's IT team works to resolve the issue and restore access to the website as quickly as possible. This is an example of availability in action.\n\nIn summary, confidentiality protects sensitive information from unauthorized access, integrity ensures the accuracy and trustworthiness of information, and availability ensures timely and reliable access to systems and data."}
